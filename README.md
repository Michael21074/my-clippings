# kipar
kindle highlights and notes are stored in a "My Clippings".txt file in an ugly format. 

This program makes your kindle notes more readable.

You might recognize this program from its previous name: clippings_parser

The old name took far too long to type. It is now kipar aka the KIndle note PARser.

Pronounced kip-are with a hard r, definitely not kipper

update coming soon: this program will dump your highlights into a mysql database instead of just reprinting it. 

update coming farther along: this program will write your highlights to a new file in a prettier format and set up an interactive library of highlights.
