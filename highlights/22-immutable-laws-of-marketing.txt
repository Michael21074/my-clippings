  22 Immutable Laws of Marketing
  by Al Ries
______________________________

 pg 2 - 1 The Law of Leadership It’s better to be first than it is to be better.

 pg 10 - 2 The Law of the Category If you can’t be first in a category, set up a new category you can be first in.

 pg 12 - The most successful computer company of the seventies and eighties, next to IBM, was Digital Equipment Corporation. IBM was first in computers. DEC was first in minicomputers.

 pg 12 - Commodore was just another manufacturer of home personal computers that wasn’t going anywhere until it positioned the Amiga as the first multimedia computer.

 pg 13 - When you launch a new product, the first question to ask yourself is not “How is this new product better than the competition?” but “First what?” In other words, what category is this new product first in?

 pg 14 - 3 The Law of the Mind It’s better to be first in the mind than it is to be first in the marketplace

 pg 15 - Du Mont invented the first commercial television set. Duryea introduced the first automobile. Hurley introduced the first washing machine. All are gone. Is something wrong with the law of leadership in chapter 1? No, but the law of the mind modifies it. It’s better to be first in the prospect’s mind than first in the marketplace. Which, if anything, understates the importance of being first in the mind. Being first in the mind is everything in marketing. Being first in the marketplace is important only to the extent that it allows you to get in the mind first. For example, IBM wasn’t first in the marketplace with the mainframe computer. Remington Rand was first, with UNIVAC. But thanks to a massive marketing effort, IBM got into the mind first and won the computer battle early. The law of the mind follows from the law of perception. If marketing is a battle of perception, not product, then the mind takes precedence over the marketplace.

 pg 16 - Xerox was first in copiers and then tried to get into the computer business. Twenty-five years and $2 billion later, Xerox is nowhere in computers.

 pg 16 - The single most wasteful thing you can do in marketing is try to change a mind.

 pg 18 - 4 The Law of Perception Marketing is not a battle of products, it’s a battle of perception.

 pg 19 - There is no objective reality. There are no facts. There are no best products. All that exists in the world of marketing are perceptions in the minds of the customer or prospect. The perception is the reality. Everything else is an illusion.

 pg 19 - Most people think they are better perceivers than others. They have a sense of personal infallibility. Their perceptions are always more accurate than those of their neighbors or friends. Truth and perception become fused in the mind, leaving no difference between the two. It’s not easy to see that this is so. To cope with the terrifying reality of being alone in the universe, people project themselves on the outside world. They “live” in the arena of books, movies, television, newspapers, magazines. They “belong” to clubs, organizations, institutions. These outside representations of the world seem more real than the reality inside their own minds. People cling firmly to the belief that reality is the world outside of the mind and that the individual is one small speck on a global spaceship. Actually it’s the opposite. The only reality you can be sure about is in your own perceptions. If the universe exists, it exists inside your own mind and the minds of others. That’s the reality that marketing programs must deal with.

 pg 20 - Most marketing mistakes stem from the assumption that you’re fighting a product battle rooted in reality.

 pg 23 - What makes the battle even more difficult is that customers frequently make buying decisions based on second-hand perceptions. Instead of using their own perceptions, they base their buying decisions on someone else’s perception of reality. This is the “everybody knows” principle. Everybody knows that the Japanese make higher-quality cars than the Americans do. So people make buying decisions based on the fact that everybody knows the Japanese make higher-quality cars. When you ask shoppers whether they have had any personal experience with a product, most often they say they haven’t. And, more often than not, their own experience is often twisted to conform to their perceptions.

 pg 26 - 5 The Law of Focus The most powerful concept in marketing is owning a word in the prospect’s mind.

 pg 27 - In a way, the law of leadership—it’s better to be first than to be better—enables the first brand or company to own a word in the mind of the prospect. But the word the leader owns is so simple that it’s invisible. The leader owns the word that stands for the category.

 pg 27 - You can also test the validity of a leadership claim by a word association test. If the given words are computer, copier, chocolate bar, and cola, the four most associated words are IBM, Xerox, Hershey’s, and Coke. An astute leader will go one step further to solidify its position. Heinz owns the word ketchup. But Heinz went on to isolate the most important ketchup attribute. “Slowest ketchup in the West” is how the company is preempting the thickness attribute. Owning the word slow helps Heinz maintain a 50 percent market share. If you’re not a leader, then your word has to have a narrow focus. Even more important, however, your word has to be “available” in your category. No one else can have a lock on it.

 pg 28 - If you’re not a leader, then your word has to have a narrow focus. Even more important, however, your word has to be “available” in your category. No one else can have a lock on it.

 pg 28 - The most effective words are simple and benefit oriented.

 pg 28 - there’s the halo effect. If you strongly establish one benefit, the prospect is likely to give you a lot of other benefits, too.

 pg 30 - Many companies see the advantage of owning a single word or concept (often called “the corporate vision”), but they neglect to be the first to preempt the word.

 pg 31 - The essence of marketing is narrowing the focus. You become stronger when you reduce the scope of your operations

 pg 32 - Does any company proclaim itself as the “unquality” corporation? No, everybody stands for quality. As a result, nobody does.

 pg 34 - 6 The Law of Exclusivity  Two companies cannot own the same word in the prospect’s mind.

 pg 35 - Volvo owns safety. Many other automobile companies, including Mercedes-Benz and General Motors, have tried to run marketing campaigns based on safety. Yet no one except Volvo has succeeded in getting into the prospect’s mind with a safety message.

 pg 36 - What often leads marketers down this booby-trapped lane is that wonderful stuff called research.

 pg 36 - long-lasting is what people want, that’s what we should advertise. Right? Wrong. What researchers never tell you is that some other company already owns the idea.

 pg 36 - If long-lasting is what people want, that’s what we should advertise. Right? Wrong. What researchers never tell you is that some other company already owns the idea.

 pg 37 - A market study showed that the most popular attribute for fast food was “fast” (no big surprise there). So Burger King did what most red-blooded marketers do. It turned to its advertising agency and said, “If the world wants fast, our advertising should tell them we’re fast.” What was overlooked in the research was that McDonald’s was already perceived as being the fastest hamburger chain in the country. Fast belonged to McDonald’s. Undaunted by this, Burger King launched its campaign with the slogan “Best food for fast times.” The program quickly became a disaster

Fast belonged to McDonald’s. Undaunted by this, Burger King launched its campaign with the slogan “Best food for fast times.” The program quickly became a disaster very nearly on a par with the one that involved “Herb.”

 pg 38 - 7 The Law of the Ladder The strategy to use depends on which rung you occupy on the ladder.

 pg 39 - For each category, there is a product ladder in the mind. On each rung is a brand name. Take the car rental category. Hertz got into the mind first and wound up on the top rung. Avis got in second and National got in third.

 pg 39 - The reader looked at the ad and wondered, How could they have the finest rent-a-car service when they’re not on the top rung of my ladder? Then Avis did the one thing you have to do to make progress inside the mind of the prospect. They acknowledged their position on the ladder. “Avis is only No. 2 in rent-a-cars. So why go with us? We try harder.” For 13 years in a row, Avis had lost money. Then, when it admitted to being No. 2, it started to make money, lots of money.

 pg 40 - Many marketing people have misread the Avis story. They assume the company was successful because it tried harder (i.e., it had the better service). But that wasn’t it at all. Avis was successful because it related itself to the position of Hertz in the mind.

 pg 41 - How many rungs are there on your ladder? It depends on whether your product is a high-interest or a low-interest product. Products you use every day (cigarettes, cola, beer, toothpaste, cereal) tend to be high-interest products with many rungs on their ladders. Products that are purchased infrequently (furniture, lawn mowers, luggage) usually have few rungs on their ladders. Products that involve a great deal of personal pride (automobiles, watches, cameras) are also high-interest products with many rungs on their ladders even though they are purchased infrequently.

 pg 41 - There’s a relationship between market share and your position on the ladder in the prospect’s mind. You tend to have twice the market share of the brand below you and half the market share of the brand above you.

 pg 42 - What’s the maximum number of rungs on a ladder? There seems to be a rule of seven in the prospect’s mind. Ask someone to name all the brands he or she remembers in a given category. Rarely will anyone name more than seven. And that’s for a high-interest category. According to Harvard psychologist Dr. George A. Miller, the average human mind cannot deal with more than seven units at a time.

Rarely will anyone name more than seven. And that’s for a high-interest category. According to Harvard psychologist Dr. George A. Miller, the average human mind cannot deal with more than seven units at a time. Which is why seven is a popular number for lists that have to be remembered.

 pg 44 - 8 The Law of Duality In the long run, every market becomes a two-horse race.

 pg 45 - Early on, a new category is a ladder of many rungs. Gradually, the ladder becomes a two-rung affair.

 pg 46 - In a maturing industry, third place is a difficult position to be in.

 pg 46 - Take video games. In the late eighties, the market was dominated by Nintendo with a 75 percent share. The two also-rans were Sega and NEC. Today Nintendo and Sega are neck and neck, and NEC is way behind. In the long run, marketing is a two-game race.

 pg 46 - neck, and NEC is way behind. In the long run, marketing is a two-game race. Time

 pg 47 - Time frames, however, can vary. The fast-moving video game market played itself out in two or three seasons. The long-distance telephone market might take two or three decades.

 pg 48 - Look at the history of the automobile in the United States. In 1904, 195 different cars were assembled by 60 companies. Within the following 10 years, 531 companies were formed and 346 perished. By 1923, only 108 car makers remained. This number dropped to 44 by 1927. Today, Ford and General Motors dominate the domestic industry, with Chrysler’s future in doubt.

 pg 49 - We repeat: The customer believes that marketing is a battle of products. It’s this kind of thinking that keeps the two brands on top: “They must be the best, they’re the leaders.”

 pg 50 - 9 The Law of the Opposite If you’re shooting for second place, your strategy is determined by the leader.

 pg 51 - When you look at customers in a given product category, there seem to be two kinds of people. There are those who want to buy from the leader and there are those who don’t want to buy from the leader. A potential No. 2 has to appeal to the latter group.

 pg 51 - When you look at customers in a given product category, there seem to be two kinds of people. There are those who want to buy from the leader and there are those who don’t want to buy from the leader. A potential No. 2 has to appeal to the latter group. In other words, by positioning yourself against the leader, you take business away from all the other alternatives to No. 1. If old people drink Coke and young people drink Pepsi, there’s nobody left to drink Royal Crown cola.

 loc 135 - “FedEx this package to the Coast.” If you’re introducing the first brand in a new category, you should always try to select a name that can work generically. (Lawyers advise the opposite, but what do they know about the laws of marketing?)
