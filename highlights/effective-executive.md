#  Effective Executive
## by Peter Drucker

 - loc 188 - People endowed with tremendous brilliance are often “strikingly ineffectual.”

 - loc 209 - Do what you’re made for, yes, but then get better and better; eradicate weakness, yes, but only within strength.

 - loc 216 - Drucker gave me the confidence to calendar white space in the morning and to be belligerently reclusive during creative hours. No one but you can take responsibility to leverage how you best work, and the sooner you do, the more years you have to gain the cumulative effect of tens of thousands of hours well spent.

 - loc 223 - The “secret” of people who do so many difficult things, writes Drucker, is that they do only one thing at a time;

 - loc 242 - there is an overhead cost to any good decision: It requires argument and debate, time for reflection and concentration, and energy expended to ensure superb execution. So, given this overhead cost, it’s far better to zoom out and make a few big generic decisions that can apply to a large number of specific situations, to find a pattern within—in short, to go from chaos to concept.

 - loc 252 - If you make one distinctive contribution—a key decision that would not have happened without your leadership (even if no one ever credits you for your catalytic role)—then you will have rendered a great service.”

 - loc 263 - If it were a decision today to start something you are already in (to enter a business, to hire a person, to institute a policy, to launch a project, etc.), would you? If not, then why do you persist?

 - loc 267 - The accomplishments of a single right person in a key seat dwarf the combined accomplishment of dividing the seat among multiple B-players. Get better people, give them really big things to do, enlarge their responsibilities, and let them work.

 - loc 284 - “You will probably survive.” He continued: “And you seem to spend a lot of energy on the question of how to be successful. But that is the wrong question.” He paused, then like the Zen master thwacking the table with a bamboo stick: “The question is: how to be useful!”

 - loc 285 - “And you seem to spend a lot of energy on the question of how to be successful. But that is the wrong question.” He paused, then like the Zen master thwacking the table with a bamboo stick: “The question is: how to be useful!”

 - loc 328 - What made them all effective is that they followed the same eight practices:             • They asked, “What needs to be done?”             • They asked, “What is right for the enterprise?”             • They developed action plans.             • They took responsibility for decisions.             • They took responsibility for communicating.             • They were focused on opportunities rather than problems.             • They ran productive meetings.             • They thought and said “we” rather than “I.”

 - loc 352 - I have never encountered an executive who remains effective while tackling more than two tasks at a time.

 - loc 355 - after completing the original top-priority task, the executive resets priorities rather than moving on to number two from the original list.

 - loc 360 - He asked himself which of the two or three tasks at the top of the list he himself was best suited to undertake. Then he concentrated on that task; the others he delegated.

 - loc 385 - The action plan is a statement of intentions rather than a commitment. It must not become a straitjacket. It should be revised often, because every success creates new opportunities. So does every failure.

 - loc 389 - the action plan needs to create a system for checking the results against the expectations.

 - loc 389 - the action plan needs to create a system for checking the results against the expectations. Effective executives usually build two such checks into their action plans. The first check comes halfway through the plan’s time period; for example, at nine months. The second occurs at the end, before the next action plan is drawn up.

 - loc 400 - Take responsibility for decisions A decision has not been made until people know:             • the name of the person accountable for carrying it out;             • the deadline;             • the names of the people who will be affected by the decision and therefore have to know about, understand, and approve it—or at least not be strongly opposed to it; and             • the names of the people who have to be informed of the decision, even if they are not directly affected by it.

 - loc 401 - A decision has not been made until people know:             • the name of the person accountable for carrying it out;             • the deadline;             • the names of the people who will be affected by the decision and therefore have to know about, understand, and approve it—or at least not be strongly opposed to it; and             • the names of the people who have to be informed of the decision, even if they are not directly affected by it.

 - loc 446 - Good executives focus on opportunities rather than problems. Problems have to be taken care of, of course; they must not be swept under the rug. But problem solving, however necessary, does not produce results. It prevents damage. Exploiting opportunities produces results.

 - loc 446 - Good executives focus on opportunities rather than problems. Problems have to be taken care of, of course; they must not be swept under the rug. But problem solving, however necessary, does not produce results. It prevents damage. Exploiting opportunities produces results. Above all, effective executives treat change as an opportunity rather than a threat.

 - loc 464 - Effective executives put their best people on opportunities rather than on problems.

 - loc 517 - Effectiveness is a discipline. And, like every discipline, effectiveness can be learned and must be earned.

 - loc 526 - Brilliant men are often strikingly ineffectual; they fail to realize that the brilliant insight is not by itself achievement.

 - loc 530 - Intelligence, imagination, and knowledge are essential resources, but only effectiveness converts them into results.

 - loc 613 - In one business, the market research man may have a staff of two hundred people, whereas the market research man of the closest competitor is all by himself and has only a secretary for his staff. This should make little difference in the contribution expected of the two men. It is an administrative detail. Two hundred people, of course, can do a great deal more work than one man. But it does not follow that they produce and contribute more. Knowledge work is not defined by quantity. Neither is knowledge work defined by its costs. Knowledge work is defined by its results. And for these, the size of the group and the magnitude of the managerial job are not even symptoms.
