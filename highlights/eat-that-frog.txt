  Eat That Frog
  by Brian Tracy
______________________________

 pg 2 - The first rule of frog eating is this:If you have to eat two frogs, eat the ugliest one first.

 pg 3 - The second rule of frog eating is this:If you have to eat a live frog at all, it doesn't pay to sit and look at it for very long.

 pg 3 - Successful, effective people are those who launch directly into their major tasks and then discipline themselves to work steadily and single-mindedly until those tasks are complete.

 pg 4 - The habit of setting priorities, overcoming procrastination, and getting on with your most important task is a mental and physical skill. As such, this habit is learnable through practice and repetition, over and over again, until it locks into your subconscious mind and becomes a permanent part of your behavior.

 pg 14 - Planning is bringing the future into the present so that you can do something about it now.ALAN LAKEIN

 loc 70 - Then I did something that changed my life. I began to ask successful people what they were doing that enabled them to be more productive and earn more money than me. And they told me.

 loc 88 - The ability to concentrate singlemindedly on your most important task, to do it well and to finish it completely, is the key to great success, achievement, respect, status, and happiness in life.
