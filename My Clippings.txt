The Gamesmaster asked, “Monsieur Pook, how much are you willing to bet on the throw of your dice?” Pook looked at his dice. They were the dice of Talent, Dreams, and Endurance. He looked at his stack of chips, one color being whatever property and ‘things’ he had, another being his societal connections including that of his family and friends, and the most treasured type of chip of one’s most awesome resource: time. Pook told the Gamesmaster, “Put it all on the table.” The Gamesmaster looked alarmed. “But if you do that, you may lose all your property, all your society, and all your time, and thus, your life. Are you willing to bet all that on your Talent, Dreams, and Endurance?” Everyone in the Casino was looking at Pook now. Very very few people bet it all. “All on the table,” Pook repeated, rattling the dice. Laughing, he rolled the bones and said, “The greatest risk you can take in life is not to risk it all!”

War veterans despise the war they are stuck in. But if asked to leave the battlefield, they will not because of their comrades. The hellish environment created bonds between these men that last throughout their lifetime. Lasting marriages also contains this comradeship. The couple goes through this hurricane of life and by overcoming the difficulties thrown at them, it makes their bond cemented even more. So love is not weddings and flowers.

THINK the outcome is already won. THINK that she is going to do all the ungodly things you want her to, it is just a matter of WHEN. In the meantime, you have fun because YOU KNOW THE OUTCOME. Women interpret this as confidence and persistance, two traits THAT TURN THEM ON (self-fulfilling prophecy, for as you think, THEY shall become)

Dissent isn’t tolerated in the movement and stepping out of line will earn you whispers behind your back to ostracize you both socially and professionally.

In all cases, the second type of person will always gain control of the organization, and will always write the rules under which the organization functions.

It's there; you only have to find it.

One thing I've noticed is that SJWs tend to be somewhat innumerate, so they frequently fail to realize how absurd their assertions are whenever numbers are involved. Another favored tactic of the SJW is the definitional switcheroo, so always be careful to check precisely how they are defining words since you can often catch them substituting bizarre definitions of their own concoction in order to slip things past an insufficiently careful reader.
