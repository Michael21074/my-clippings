  Thinking Fast and Slow
  by Daniel Kahneman

 pg 11 - “The situation has provided a cue; this cue has given the expert access to information stored in memory, and the information provides the answer. Intuition is nothing more and nothing less than recognition.”

 pg 20 - System 1 operates automatically and quickly, with little or no effort and no sense of voluntary control. System 2 allocates attention to the effortful mental activities that demand it, including complex computations. The operations of System 2 are often associated with the subjective experience of agency, choice, and concentration.

 pg 23 - It is the mark of effortful activities that they interfere with each other, which is why it is difficult or impossible to conduct several at once.

 pg 24 - The gorilla study illustrates two important facts about our minds: we can be blind to the obvious, and we are also blind to our blindness.

 pg 28 - The best we can do is a compromise: learn to recognize situations in which mistakes are likely and try harder to avoid significant mistakes when the stakes are high. The premise of this book is that it is easier to recognize other people’s mistakes than our own.

 pg 29 - Systems 1 and 2 are not systems in the standard sense of entities with interacting aspects or parts. And there is no one part of the brain that either of the systems would call home.

 pg 29 - “Automatic system” takes longer to say than “System 1” and therefore takes more space in your working memory. This matters, because anything that occupies your working memory reduces your ability to think.
